### Typing in Aaa

Aaa is a typed language. Every stack value and every variable has a type.
The type checker makes sure that values of correct arguments are being passed to functions.

Types in Aaa come in two flavours:
* `struct`'s: data structures
* `enum`'s: enumerables

### Structs

TODO

### Enums
